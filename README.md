# boilerplate-for-lint
This is project boilerplate for lint of Javascript, React, SCSS

This is hard point because we understand que every develop have a way to programing, but for sometime different code can be a bottleneck. To fix this problem we are using eslint, pretter, stylelint and editorconfig. So to make this happen it is need to use a editor plugins(or cli) to fix it.

## For vscode

- ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode
- ext install dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
- ext install editorconfig.editorconfig

To make sure Prettier formats on save. Insert `"editor.formatOnSave": true`

## For Vim
